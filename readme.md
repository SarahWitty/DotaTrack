###About###
DotaTrack is a Software Engineering II project currently being developed at LeTourneau University. Our client, the LeTourneau MOBA Club asked us to develop an application that would allow users to track their performance over time in the Action Real-Time Strategy game Dota 2 developed by Valve Software.

The end result will be a web application that gives Dota 2 players a more in-depth historical analysis of their performance when compared to the sites currently available
(such as [DotaBuff](http://www.dotabuff.com) and [DotaMax](http://www.dotamax.com)).
